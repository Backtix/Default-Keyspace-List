# Default-Keyspace-List
Small bash script that will create a series of folders named after default keyspaces and adds (if available) links to resources.
Forked from [wpatoolkit](https://github.com/wpatoolkit), cleaned and rewritten in bash.

### You can choose if you want to add the resources:  
in text format  
`https://github.com/wpatoolkit/10-Hex-Generator`

or with clickable links in markdown  
`[10-Hex-Generator](https://github.com/wpatoolkit/10-Hex-Generator)`  
[10-Hex-Generator](https://github.com/wpatoolkit/10-Hex-Generator)

or html  
`<p><a href=https://github.com/wpatoolkit/10-Hex-Generator>10-Hex-Generator</a></p>`  
<p><a href=https://github.com/wpatoolkit/10-Hex-Generator>10-Hex-Generator</a></p>

## ToDo
- [ ] Remove dead links
- [ ] Create index file
- [ ] Add entries
